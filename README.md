# Which-Boba-Shop-To-Go
STATS141B Final Project 

Hi My final project includes 6 sections with a shiny background image from Yelp!

The first section is for users to select and enter their current college city and their favorite boba shops. 
My general idea is to help users decide which boba shop to go and how to get there.

The first main section is a plot analyzing all the boba shops in all 10 UC schools. 
Do you see the difference of Davis boba shops compared to others?

The second one is a detailed plot about your local college boba shops, specific to each boba shops.
Once you select your two favorite boba shops, you will get to see an option generated by my system 
that tells you which one is better to go and followed by a map, the fifth section, telling you how to get there!

The last part is a bonus part. It is a meme I like! 
You can only get to see this once you finish all the reviews of first 5 sections!

Please try to not skip any parts, especially the last part!
